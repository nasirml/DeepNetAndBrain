## Deep learning and Brain

This repository is a code sample of the following paper: 
"Correspondence of Deep Neural Networks and the Brain for Visual Textures" Md Nasir Uddin Laskar, Luis G Sanchez Giraldo, and Odelia Schwartz, ArXiv Preprint. Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02888

The whole project is divided into three main steps:

    step 1: Deep net output
    step 2: Qualitative comparison with the brain data
    step 3: Quantitative comparison with the brain data

Where,

Step 1: Is the process where we send the texture images to the deep net and find the output from each layer.

Step 2: Is the qualitative correspondence of deep neural networks with the brain recording data, on some metrics, as described in the paper.

Step 3: Shows the quantitative correspondence of the deep network with the brain recording data, as described in the paper.


### How to run
Just run the main function. It will invoke the step 2 of the paper and you will see a plot in the paper. You can run any part of step 3 also, as in the main.py file. To run step 1, you need to have Caffe installed in your machine.
